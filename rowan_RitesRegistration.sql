I''ve been happy enough to be able to call myself part of something based on older ways and which clearly includes my personal core components-of-faith (Nature, Love, and love for Nature), but i''ve always really been in search of  1) something in a not-clearly-Wiccan direction and much more specific and defined, with established leadership figures to learn from  (and i think it''s fair to say being an apprentice has been its own desired detail amid that)  And,  2) something very ancient.  While i understand Faery Seership itself to have been technically founded in recent decades (i have a history of odd troubles with learning about magick/Paganism through books, so i''m not sure on this but i''ll only be happier if it''s actually older), i also understand that everything it could be said to be "about", is ancient indeed.\r\nSo, Faery Seership is striking me as a very likely fit so far, and i am hoping that being a part of this clan this year, will prove a nice decisive first step towards joining the tradition.\r\n\r\nOther relevant considerations are mostly events, with some that have been directly related to Faery Seership/White Raven Clan.\r\nOn a couple of occasions, i have been attending a workshop given by Orion Foxwood at Rites of Spring, and he has said something that perhaps - or even likely - had relevance for everyone, but which really seriously seemed to be speaking to me specifically.  On one such occasion, something he said about ancestor work - more specifically, about working on behalf of our ancestors - struck & shook me as though my ancestors were reacting/responding to it from within me.  For various other reasons as well as because of my experience in that moment, i''m pretty sure i have some very significant ancestor work to do.\r\nThis past Rites, i happened to cabin with a Faery Seership apprentice, and we had a particular conversation of depth, that after hitting on certain deep details about me, seemed to trigger a full-blown autistic episode in me.  (Yes, i am diagnosed as ''on the spectrum''.  There is no real potential for danger from it, especially if i''m surrounded by loving & understanding people; even such an episode just gets me extremely withdrawn, which i''ll come out of either with a heartfelt & somewhat prolonged "bearhug", or on my own in a matter of minutes, always less than an hour so far.  And all this never minding, that such episodes are very rare for me.)\r\nI am not inclined to think that that particular autistic episode, was just as simple as that (an autistic episode), though it may have more or less been so, in which case i just don''t yet know how broadly applicable the healing power of Faery Seership magick is.  That lack of inclination on my part, though, is due to the way the conversation sort-of-but-not-exactly continued, after the aforementioned ''trigger'' moment:  Once it was clear that i was no longer simply ok despite being basically still able to communicate via spoken English, the apprentice in question (wish i could remember her name) began what seemed like very soft chanting, and while that didn''t simply bring me back to coherency, it did return enough lucidity to me so that i actually remember that part of things & what followed, and i''m pretty sure it also did set me up for a significantly sooner return to functional coherency.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are some less directly-relevant events.\r\nI have spoken with exactly one self-identifying 100% full-blown from-birth psychic, whose situation is apparently due to a twin having been stillborn or something very similar.  According to her, the majority of my spirit guides "picture", is ancestors of one kind or another.\r\nI understand dream work to be a fairly significant part of Faery Seership (and maybe also ancestor work generally), and i have an ongoing experience of dream "events" of prescient nature, which in more direct terms is a matter of having a dream during REM sleep, maybe remembering it upon waking though likely not, and then anywhere from a few days to more than a week later, experiencing that exact dream - every detail exactly the same - as a moment in my fully-awake life.  At that final point, i''ll also almost always remember when i had the REM-sleep dream in which i first experienced said moment, if i didn''t remember the dream upon waking up & having just dreamt it.\r\nI''ve been having such dreams i suppose not regularly, but certainly somewhat frequently since i was 20, though the very first time it happened i was somewhere right around six years old.\r\n\r\nFinally, past the question of events, there is one more factor tugging me toward this clan.  Just a few years ago, i came to the full understanding than i am a bigendered person:  while simply male-bodied, i have both a full male psychology/psyche, and a full female psychology/psyche; i am, anatomy/physiology aside, fully a man and fully a woman (though i am not certain of their existing separately in terms of brain structure, or of a number of other details).  And while i couldn''t hope to describe the particulars of why, my active female subconscious seems pretty enthusiastic about and maybe even really intent upon, joining probably Faery Seership and certainly White Raven Clan.  I''m not sure just how much reason i have to associate queerness/gender-queerness with this clan specifically, but there it is.\r\n\r\nI honestly haven''t had much training in decisively Pagan terms (as we''re directed to describe our history of here), and what i have had, has basically all been through either workshops at Rites of Spring, or Twilight Covening clans:  Lynx (Eric Arthen), Ibis (Wolf Grathwohl), Ptarmigan (Jane Sibley & Ed Wilson), and Manx Shearwater (Miriam Klamkin).\r\nOutside of decisively Pagan training, i have also had a fair amount of training in the Taoist arts of T''ai Chi and Ba Gua, and i have been fully attuned in Usui Reiki (i hate applying any term to that, that includes the word ''master''), all three under instructors apparently not known to Earthspirit folk (though i''m somewhat surprised nobody''s heard of Arthur Goodridge or Peter Wayne).\r\n\r\nWe are also directed to describe our supports at home, in these little essays.\r\nAnd i do have such resources, including a fairly well-matched clinical psychologist, an acupuncturist i''ve been going to since i was a child, an attentive immediate family living nearby, great proximity to the core of the Earthspirit community and many other members, a Buddhist retreat center that knows me (and the "support" of the technique, ''Vipassana'', which that same retreat center has taught me very well), a kind of support/interest group for young Pagans (in-town for me), and a few Pagan elders whom i''m friends with in my town & neighboring towns.\r\nIt is my understanding that you wish to know that we have these supports available to us in our daily lives, in the event of our having a particularly rough or very intense Twilight Covening, so that any instability arising from such an extended weekend may be soothed, healed, relaxed, re-stabilized.\r\nI have deep conviction that if there is any related & realistic concern to be had in my case this year, it would pertain to my not being part of this clan, this Twilight Covening.  Put more simply, i am worried about my own mental health going into this coming Winter, if i am not part of this year''s White Raven Clan.
